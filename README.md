# SimpleBlog

A blog so simple, it doesn't even have a name. It's a super lightweight ASP.NET/C# application, but completely atypical of most by not using forms, (though controls and masters are used) databases, or anything but the filesystem. The inspirations are from light blog scripts like Blosxom and hl--, resulting in a minimal blog.

It has been tested on xsp and mod_mono on FreeBSD and Debian. Make sure you have a framework compatible with 3.5.

## Usage

* Edit Web.config as needed.
* Tweak Blog.master to your design.
* Write Markdown formatted posted in the posts directory.
* Drop the contents somewhere, and it should Just Work.
